# Vending-Machine
Vending Machine is a hardware-based project designed to simulate a vending machine using VHDL. The vending machine accepts coins of 5, 10, and 50 bani, calculating the total input and dispensing a soda can when the total reaches 1 leu. The system manages a variety of states, including coin validation, product availability, and rest calculation.
